                The PPF account or Public Provident Fund scheme is one of the most popular long-term saving-cum-investment products, mainly due to its combination of safety, returns and tax savings.

                The PPF was first offered to the public in the year 1968 by the Finance Ministry’s National Savings Institute.  Since then it has emerged as a powerful tool to create long-term wealth for investors.

                Investors use the PPF as a tool to build a corpus for their retirement by putting aside sums of money regularly, over long periods of time (PPF has a 15-year maturity, and the facility to extend the tenure). With its attractive interest rates and tax benefits, the PPF is a big favourite with a small saver.

            <p >Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is an investment route offered by Mutual Funds wherein one can invest a fixed amount in a Mutual Fund scheme at regular intervals– say once a month or once a quarter, instead of making a lump-sum investment. The installment amount could be as little as INR 500 a month and is similar to a recurring deposit. It’s convenient as you can give your bank standing instructions to debit the amount every month.</p>
            <p>SIP has been gaining popularity among Indian MF investors, as it helps in investing in a disciplined manner without worrying about market volatility and timing the market. Systematic Investment Plans offered by Mutual Funds are easily the best way to enter the world of investments</p>

            <p class="p-5">ULIP full form is Unit Linked Insurance Plan, which is a multi-faceted life insurance product. A ULIP plan is a combination of life insurance and investment. ULIPs requires you (as a policyholder) to make regular premium payments, part of which is utilised to provide life insurance coverage. The remaining is pooled with the assets received from other policyholders, and then invested in financial instruments (i.e. equity and debt), similar to mutual funds. Investment in ULIP means you can stay financially secure against emergencies and grow your money as well.</p>
